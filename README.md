Outsmart the AI in a strategic game of cooperation and betrayal. Choose to cooperate or defect each round, accumulating points to win.

# Explanation
Hey there! Welcome to the game of strategic choices and mutual decisions - it's a bit like rock-paper-scissors, but with a twist. You'll be playing against an artificial intelligence we fondly call 🤖. Don't worry, it's not Skynet or anything.

In each round, you have two choices: 'cooperate' or 'defect'. Think of it like deciding whether to do your share of the dishes or sneak off and leave it for your roommate. 

If both you and 🤖 decide to 'cooperate' - like you both decided to do your dishes - you both receive 15 points. Teamwork makes the dream work, right?

But let's say you decide to 'defect' while 🤖 decides to 'cooperate' - like you promised to do the dishes but didn't. In this case, you receive a full 20 points and 🤖 gets nothing. Feels a bit unfair, doesn't it? But remember, 🤖 might remember that and act accordingly in the next rounds.

If you choose to 'cooperate' and 🤖 defects - like you ended up doing all the dishes - you will be left with nothing while 🤖 gets all the 20 points. It's a bit of a bummer, but that's how the game goes sometimes.

Finally, if both of you decide to 'defect', you each get only 5 points. It's like if neither of you did the dishes and now you're both eating takeout off napkins.

Your goal is to outsmart 🤖 and rack up as many points as you can over a number of rounds. The one with the most points at the end wins. Good luck, and remember, it's all in good fun!

Oh, and one more thing: if you decide not to play, that's completely okay. But don't worry, the fun won't stop there. We have two of our resident AIs, HAL and Data, who will step in and play the game. So, you can sit back, relax, and watch how two AIs navigate this strategic landscape. Enjoy!
